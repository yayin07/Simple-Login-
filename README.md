# Simple-Login-

The overall structure of the login form is contained within a div element with the classes flex, items-center, and justify-center. This allows the form to be centered vertically and horizontally on the screen, utilizing the full height of the viewport (h-screen).

Inside the form, there are two main input fields: one for the username and another for the password.

Each input field is wrapped inside a div element with the class mb-4 (margin-bottom: 4) or mb-6 (margin-bottom: 6) to add some vertical spacing between the fields.

For each input field, there is a corresponding label element with the classes block, text-gray-700, text-sm, and font-bold. These classes style the labels to have a readable font size, a bold font weight, and a gray color. The block class ensures that each label appears on a new line.

The input fields themselves are input elements with the classes shadow, appearance-none, border, rounded, w-full, py-2, px-3, text-gray-700, leading-tight, focus:outline-none, and focus:shadow-outline.

The shadow class adds a subtle shadow effect to the input fields.
The appearance-none class removes the default styling provided by the browser.
The border class adds a border around the input fields.
The rounded class adds rounded corners to the input fields.
The w-full class ensures that the input fields take up the full width available.
The py-2 class adds vertical padding to the input fields.
The px-3 class adds horizontal padding to the input fields.
The text-gray-700 class sets the text color to a dark gray shade.
The leading-tight class adjusts the line height to make the text appear vertically centered within the input fields.
The focus:outline-none class removes the default focus outline when the input fields are selected.
The focus:shadow-outline class adds a shadow outline when the input fields are selected.
Each input field also has a placeholder attribute that provides a hint or description of the expected input.

Lastly, there is a button element with the classes bg-blue-500, hover:bg-blue-700, text-white, font-bold, py-2, px-4, rounded, focus:outline-none, and focus:shadow-outline. These classes style the button with a blue background color that changes to a darker shade on hover, white text, bold font weight, and rounded corners. The focus:outline-none and focus:shadow-outline classes remove the default focus outline and add a shadow outline when the button is focused.
